  /**
    * When it comes to Scala, the term for-loop is a kind of misuse.
    *
    * The constructs above look like loops, but are rather named for-comprehensions in Scala.
    * In the examples above, we relied on side effects within the comprehensions because it resemble the loops you're
    * probably used to, but is not idiomatic Scala.
    *
    * But what is a for-comprehension ?
    *
    * For-comprehensions go well beyond simple iteration. They can be applied to many more data structures than just Lists.
    * A very important point is that it is the data structures that 'knows' how to navigate trough its elements, so the
    * programmer does not need to bother with that mere implementation details.
    *
    * A for-comp is composed of two parts :
    *
    *   - a series of one or more 'generators' (defined using <-) that can have an optional filter (using if)
    *   - a body where we define what we do with each individual element of the structure. The 'yield' keyword
    *     indicates that we produce a new element for each input element, thus transforming our input structure into a new one
