*  The 'var' and 'val' keywords are used to declare new variables.
*  We can make variables not visible from the outside by adding the keyword 'private' before the definition
*  By default variables are public.
*
*     - var : declares a mutable variable (which value can be modified afterwards)
*
*     - val : declares an immutable variable (this is the most usual kind of variables)
