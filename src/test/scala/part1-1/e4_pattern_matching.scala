  * Pattern matching
  *
  * Pattern matching is a very powerful technique that allows us to reason about the structure
  * of object (without breaking type erasure principle).
  *
  * Using pattern matching, we can extract some pieces of an object, do different things according
  * to its shape or properties, etc.
  *
  * It can be seen as a functional alternative to polymorphic dispatch.

  /**
    * Pattern matching is most often used via the 'match' construct.
    * This can be seen as a generalization of the switch of languages like Java or C.
    *
    * Like any other construct in Scala, a match block is a fully fledged expression, that has
    * a type and a value.
    *
    * It has the following form :
    *
    *   expr match {
    *     case pattern1 => expr1
    *     case pattern2 => expr2
    *     ...
    *     case patternN => exprN
  *     }
    *
    * Notice the case keyword, it's not a coincidence that it is the same that the one we use to
    * declare case classes !
    *
    * Each pattern is attempted in order, the first that matches expr wins and its body (exprI)
    * is evaluated to give the result of the block.
    * If no pattern matches, a (runtime) MatchError is raised, but the compiler does its best to
    * detect incomplete match blocks (where the programmer did not cover all the possible cases),
    * in order to reduce the risk of run time MatchErrors.
