/**
  * Lets build our own collection type !
  *
  * Well, this will be quite a boring and useless collection, but hopefully, it
  * will give you some insight about how Scala's collection work internally.
  *
  * We'll define the Bag structure, which is a collection containing exactly one
  * element (boring, eh ?). We'll define just enough methods on it so that users
  * can interact with it, without the need of knowing its (dead simple) internal
  * structure.
  *
  * Before jumping into the implementation (i.e, replacing the ??? bellow with
  * actual code), we need to fill the few blanks ( __ ) in the tests at the
  * bottom of the file.
  *
  * Although it is a very simple structure, the methods you'll have to implement
  * can appear a bit strange to you. But fear not, "all" you have to do is to
  * apply a precept that is pervasive in Scala programming : Just Follow the Typesâ„¢
