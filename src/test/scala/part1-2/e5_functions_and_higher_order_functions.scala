/**
  * Before digging deeper into the collections API, we need to look further into functions
  * and higher order functions
  *
  * We already know about methods, that are some kind of functions and which are defined
  * on a class (or an object) using the keyword 'def'.
  *
  *
  * Functions, on the other hand, are plain values like Ints or Booleans. We can attach
  * a function to a variable, pass it as a parameter to a method (or function), and return it
  * as a result. We can also see methods as fields of a class whose value is a function.
  *
  * Functions that manipulate other functions (by taking them as parameters and/or returning
  * other functions) are called higher-order functions. We've already seen examples of such
  * higher-order functions (or rather methods) with map and filter.
  *
  * Internally, functions are modelled as instances of a FunctionN trait. For example, functions
  * of no argument implement the Function0 trait, functions of one argument implement Function1,
  * and so on up to Function21 (that is, you cannot define functions with more than 21 arguments).
  *
  * The FunctionN traits define only one method 'apply' that take N arguments. There is a special rule
  * in Scala syntax that allow to call methods named 'apply' without typing the name, that is :
  *
  *   someInstance.apply(x)
  *
  * is equivalent to
  *
  *   someInstance(x)
  *
  * The notation "x => x + 1" we've seen before is mere syntactic sugar that eases the creation of a subclass of Function1.
  *
  * But the => keyword can also be used to denote function *types*. For example,
  *
  *   Int => Int
  *
  * denotes the type of functions that take an Int as parameter and return an Int.
  * Such types can grow to arbitrary complexity :
  *
  *   (Int, String) => Boolean          is the type of functions that take an Int and a String and return a Boolean
  *
  *   (String, Int => Int) => String    is ???
  *
  *   (Long => Int) => (Long => Long)   is ???
  *
  *   ... etc

  /**
    * Currying
    *
    * Functions enjoy a nice property called "currying", after the name of Haskell Curry, who first formalised it
    * back in the 50's.
    *
    * To put it in Scala syntax, we can say that :
    *
    *   (A, B) => C
    *
    * is strictly equivalent to :
    *
    *   A => B => C               we could also have written A => (B => C)
    *
    * In english, we would say that :
    *   a function that takes two parameters of types A and B and returns a result of type C
    * is strictly equivalent to
    *   a function of one parameter of type A that returns a function of one parameter of type B that returns a C
    *
    * In Scala, we can define functions in their curried form by specifying multiple parameters groups.
    * For example :
    *
    *   def addCurried(x: Int)(y: Int): Int = x + y
    *
    * Does the same thing that :
    *
    *   def addSimple(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
    *
    * But enables us to do things like this :
    *
    *   val increment : Int => Int = addCurried(1)    which can be written more concisely :
    *   val increment = addCurried(1) _               notice the _ placeholder, it tells the compiler to make a function
    *                                                 out of the partially applied parameters, rather than attempting a
    *                                                 function call (that wouldn't compile since all parameter are not
    *                                                 specified).
    *
    * Finally, we can transform a function of multiple parameters into its curried counterpart by calling the 'curried'
    * method on it.
